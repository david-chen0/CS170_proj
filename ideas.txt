Ideas:

Find most vital nodes then find most vital edges and return the value from removing those

Could try a randomzied selection after where it selects a random amount of vital nodes to remove, then
vital edges, then vital nodes, and so on until no more nodes/edges can be removed or any removal
would have no effect on the SPT

When removing nodes/edges, find the shortest s-t path and only try removing nodes/edges along that path, as all other nodes/edges being removed will not affect the shortest s-t path


If shortest path length can no longer be increased between iterations, might have to randomly(or use a heuristic) choose a city/edge to delete so that the next one will decrease shortest path length.
